            650 conductors. Calculate the generated e.m.f. when the flux per pole is 0.055

            II . Calculate speed at which the armature must be driven to generate an e.m.f.

            • As the flux is alternating, according to faradays law of electromagnetic 
            induction, mutually induced emf gets developed in the secondary winding, 
            this emf drives a current through it.
            • Thus though there is no electrical contact between the two windings, an 
            electrical energy gets transferred from primary to secondary.
